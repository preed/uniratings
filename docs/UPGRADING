==========

-- OpenRatings now stores full hostnames in addition to IP addresses; this 
requires administrators to create a new table in the database. See bug 63 for 
more information.

To make this change, run the following command from the MySQL monitor 
(command line client):

CREATE TABLE or_hostnames (
  hostid int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment PRIMARY KEY,
  ipaddr char(8) NOT NULL default '',
  hostname varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
  recorded datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  lastseen datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  KEY ipaddr_idx (ipaddr)
) 

1.x -> 1.2
==========

-- OpenRatings is now distributed as two separate modules: the OpenRatings
professor ratings engine and a separate user interface module. If you're
using CVS, you must checkout the new 'openratingsUI' module. If you've
pulled down the source, you'll need to download the associated OpenRatings
UI tar.gz file off the website. Bug 15 has the details of the new 
architecture.

When upgrading the engine, you'll also need to define some new constants in
Constants.php, specifically the SITEUI_URL and the UI_ROOT constant; see
step 12 in docs/INSTALL for more info.

Finally, you'll probably want to run the new 'fixperms.pl' script; see
steps 5 and 6 in docs/INSTALL for more info.

1.0 -> 1.1
==========

-- All tables in the database must be renamed; see bug 21 for more 
information.

To make this change, run the following command from the MySQL monitor 
(command line client):

RENAME TABLE abbrev_map TO or_abbrev_map, campus TO or_campus, college TO
or_college, comment TO or_comment, comment_text TO or_comment_text, course TO 
or_course, dept TO or_dept, moderated_comment_text TO or_moderated_comment_text,
objects TO or_objects, professor TO or_professor, transaction_types TO 
or_transaction_types, transactions TO or_transactions;
